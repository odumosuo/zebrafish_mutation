# Identification of the *mtk50f* mutation in *Vangl2* in zebrafish

## Description
This project identified the genetic basis for the *mtk50f* mutation in *Vangl2* in zebrafish. *Vangl2* mutants, notably *mtk50f*, *2m209*, and *2m747* exhibit variable sensitivities to canonical Wnt ligand Wnt8a. While the *m209* and *m747* alleles have been identified, the genetic basis of the mtk50f allele remains unknown and is essential for understanding Wnt pathway interactions. This study probes the *Vangl2mtk50f* mutation's genetics. Results unveil a multi-nucleotide polymorphism (MNP) in intron 5 that is predicted to generate a variation of the polyadenylation signal and cause premature termination. The mutation causes abnormal transcripts without exons 6-8 that retain part of intron 5. Though constrained by sample size and theory-based methods, this study lays groundwork for future *Vangl* gene research. Crucially, Vangl mutations uniquely induce NTDs, underlining research significance. By shedding light on conditions like spina bifida and anencephaly, this analysis advances comprehension of Wnt signaling-related human disorders.
